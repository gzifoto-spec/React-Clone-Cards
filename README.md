# React Clone Cards  
A tiny React exercise: clone a “card” component and practice passing props.

**What this repo is**
- A teaching demo built by Prof. Ana Aragón ([@anaaragon88](https://github.com/anaaragon88))  
- Starter code is a single `App.jsx` that renders one card; students fork it, add two more cards, push back to GitHub.
